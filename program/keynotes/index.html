              <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
              
              <p>The evolution of the Information and Communication Technology industry has been characterized by dramatic paradigm shifts in the past, including the transition from mainframe to the client-server model, and later the emergence of the Internet and browser-based computing. Each paradigm shift has also had a dramatic impact on the structure and the operational model of datacenters, and the software that runs in them. We are presently going through one more paradigm shift: the virtualization and de-materialization of the datacenters.  This shift to cloud computing is transforming the infrastructure, platforms, and applications from being mostly static and customized in their deployment to being elastic and standardized. This talk will describe the nature and status of this transition, and explore some research questions that are emerging from it.</p>

His areas of interest include operating systems, datacenter infrastructure (systems and networking), and computer architecture.</p>
              
                <p>Before joining EPFL, Edouard spent 18 years in the US, where he studied at Stanford and co-founded two startups: VMware and Nuova Systems (acquired by Cisco). At VMware from 1998 until 2005, he played many roles including CTO. At Nuova/Cisco from 2005 until 2011, he helped build the core engineering team and became the VP/CTO of Cisco’s Server, Access, and Virtualization Technology Group, a group that brought to market Cisco’s Unified Computing System (UCS) platform for virtualized datacenters.</p>
              
                <p>Together with his colleagues, he received the ACM Software System Award for VMware 1.0 (2009). His paper Disco: Running Commodity Operating Systems on Scalable Multiprocessors” was entered into the ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award (2008). He also received the Infoworld “Top 25 CTO Award” (2004) while at VMware.</p>

              <h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h3>
              
              <p>The famous 20th Century architect Le Corbusier defined a building as “a machine for living.” Many of us have experienced intense frustration and unhappiness with “the machines” in which we live and work. With the ever increasing embedding of information technology within the built environment, in the form of sensors, actuators, displays, cameras, network connectivity, and programmable controllers all potentially coupled to sophisticated building management systems, the ability for buildings to become aware of and respond to the needs and desires of their occupants is finally emerging. The hoped for result is more comfortable and productive occupants inside of buildings that are more efficient and sustainable in their operation. In this talk, we discuss the computer science research challenges in creating Software-Defined Buildings, an important category of cyber-physical system, and describe a project underway at Berkeley to develop new technologies and frameworks to make the vision of such buildings a reality (<a href="http://sdb.cs.berkeley.edu/sdb/">http://sdb.cs.berkeley.edu/sdb/</a>).</p>

              <a href="http://bnrg.eecs.berkeley.edu/~randy/">Randy Howard Katz</a> received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University (1976), and his M.S. (1978) and Ph.D. (1980) degrees from the University of California, Berkeley. After a year in industry and two years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he joined the Berkeley faculty in 1983. Since 1996 he has been the United Microelectronics Corporation Distinguished Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He is a Fellow of the ACM, the IEEE, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2007, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Helsinki, and in 2011, the Public Service Medal presented by the President of Singapore. He has published over 300 refereed technical papers, book chapters, and books. He has supervised 53 M.S. theses and 43 Ph.D. dissertations. He has received sixteen best paper awards, including the triple “test of time” RAID paper and one paper selected for a 50 year retrospective on IEEE Communications publications), and three best presentation awards. His academic recognitions include the CS Division’s Diane S. McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching, the Jim and Donna Gray Faculty Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the Berkeley Academic Senate Distinguished Teaching Award, the ASEE Frederic E. Terman Award, the IEEE James H. Mulligan Jr. Education Medal, the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award, the IEEE Reynolds Johnson Information Storage Award, the ACM Sigmobile Outstanding Contributor Award, the Outstanding Alumni Award of the Computer Science Division, the CRA Outstanding Service Award, and the Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Decoration. In the late 1980s, with colleagues at Berkeley, he developed Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), a $15 billion per year industry sector. On secondment to DARPA in 1993-1994, he established whitehouse.gov and connected the White House to the Internet. His current research interests are data analytics (AmpLab), Smart Grid (LoCal), and Software-Defined Buildings (SDB).</p>
