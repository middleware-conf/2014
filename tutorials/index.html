                      <p>Infrastructure software, such as operating systems and middleware, is
              large, diverse, and fast evolving, to meet changing needs in terms of
              hardware support, performance, and security.  In practice, meeting these
              needs can involve repetitive code changes, and can introduce bugs, either
              due to inattention or due to misunderstanding of evolving interfaces.
              Some potentially valuable changes may even be considered to be to
              expensive or too risky to implement.  To reduce the cost and risk of
              making pervasive code changes, we have developed the Coccinelle program
              matching and transformation tool for C code.  Coccinelle makes it possible
              to automate pervasive source code evolutions and common bug finding tasks,
              via a patch-like notation that is accessible to C code developers.
              Coccinelle is widely used in the Linux kernel developer community and in
              the development of other open source projects.</p>
              
                      <p>This interactive tutorial will give an overview of Coccinelle.  A number
              of real examples from the Linux kernel will be presented.</p>

                      <p>This tutorial addresses the challenges for middleware to process events in large scale environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Traditional event-based middleware follows an interaction model based on three decoupling dimensions: space, time, and synchronization. However, event producers and consumers are tightly coupled by event semantics: types, attributes, and values. This limits scalability in heterogeneous environments due to difficulties in establishing semantic agreements. The tutorial will motivate and explore this problem within the context of a Smart City IoT deployment.</p>
              
                      <p>The tutorial grounds the discussion in the fundamental principles for information exchange between systems and presents a review of computational paradigms and discusses different approaches to the problem. It examines the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and concludes with discussion on how to build working software for heterongeous IoT environments.</p>

                      <p>Data volumes are ever growing, for a large application spectrum going from traditional database applications, scientific simulations to emerging applications including Web 2.0 and online social networks. To cope with this added weight of Big Data, we have recently witnessed a paradigm shift in the way data is processed through the MapReduce model. First promoted by Google, MapReduce has become, due to the popularity of its open-source implementation Hadoop, the de facto programming paradigm for Big Data processing in large-scale data centers and clouds. Yet, to meet the ever-growing size of Big Data, Hadoop has been recently deployed on large-scale data centers equipped with thousands of servers that are energy hungry. This results in a tremendous increase in the energy consumed to operate these large-scale data centers and ends up with not only high money bills but also high carbon emission. The goal of this tutorial is to serve as a first step towards not only exploring the Hadoop MapReduce engine but also provide a deep insight into the challenges for making Big Data greener and discuss the main approaches developed in the literature.</p>

                      <p>Resource management is critical for application domains where components share their execution environments but belong to different stakeholders, such as smart homes or cloud systems. Yet, current middleware and application containers often hide system-level details needed for dynamic resource management. In particular, they tend to hide resource usage by offering automatic management of these resources (e.g., CPU, memory and I/O). In contrast, system-level containers, such as Linux Containers (LXC), allow fine-grain resource management. However, they lack knowledge about the application’s structure and its requirements in order to provide fine tuned resource management.</p>
              
                      <p>In this tutorial, we will expose Squirrel: a new middleware which aims at combining the benefits from the component based software engineering to design flexible and modular application and the system level containers to manage resources. Squirrel follows an approach where developers specify contracts on components and connections to describe the expected behavior of their application regarding resource consumption. These high-level contracts are then used to automatically configure the system-level containers which will hosts the running applications. At the end of this tutorial, applicants will be able to design applications and contracts using Squirrel and run their application inside system level containers to ensure a correct behavior of their application regarding resource consumption.</p>
